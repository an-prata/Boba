# Boba
An open source and cross platform password manager utilizing the RSA encryption algorithm. Boba is built on Eto, a cross platform native GUI framework which can be found here: https://github.com/picoe/Eto. As of now I have no way of testing the app on MacOS as I dont own a Mac, and there will be no support for mobile as of now. There is another version (Boba.AvaloniaDesktop) that runs on Avalonia as well.
